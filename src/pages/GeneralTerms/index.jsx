                3.0 The use of cookies and remarketing. ‍TWICE may use "cookies"
                when the User browses any of its web pages. A "cookie" can be
                defined as a text file that a website stores on the hard disk of
                your computer containing information relating to the User. Once
                your browser is closed, the cookie implanted on your computer's
                hard drive ceases to function. TWICE reserves the right to use
                its cookies to make the online services it provides to Users
                more effective and efficient. The advantages of accepting our
                cookies translate into time savings as the User will not have to
                check the registration process repeatedly. The additional
                advantage of cookies is that they allow us to track and target
                your interests in order to facilitate your stay on our Website.
